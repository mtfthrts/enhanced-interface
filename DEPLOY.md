1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g. "thrts-hud-interface")
4. Leave it as a public repository (or private if you prefer)
5. Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"
7. Follow the second set of instructions: "â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line"

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/thrts-hud-interface.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

## Deploy to Vercel

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in (you can use your GitHub account)
2. Click "Add New..." > "Project"
3. Find and select your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Vite project
5. Configure your project:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Build Command: (leave as default) `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: (leave as default) `dist`
   - Install Command: (leave as default) `npm install`
6. Click "Deploy"

Vercel will build and deploy your project, and provide you with a URL like `https://thrts-hud-interface.vercel.app`.

### Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" > "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain and follow the instructions to set up DNS records

## Updating Your Site

```
